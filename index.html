            I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on
            algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social
            and information systems, and their broader societal implications.

        In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences
        in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an
        introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of
        ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.

        a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010
        <ul>
          <li>
            This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
            entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
            introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
            support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented
            with optional advanced sections.

          <li>
            This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we
            both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate
            algorithms course.
